## Image Processing Utilities

This repository contains two Python scripts for image processing: JpgToPngConverter.py and images.py. These scripts perform various tasks such as converting image formats, resizing images, and applying filters.

## Prerequisites
    Python 3.x
    Pillow library


## You can install the Pillow library using pip:
    pip install Pillow

## Scripts

1. JpgToPngConverter.py
This script converts JPEG images to PNG format and saves them in a specified output folder.

    python JpgToPngConverter.py <input_folder> <output_folder>
    python JpgToPngConverter.py Pokedex/ new/

2. images.py
This script performs various image manipulations such as resizing, filtering, converting to grayscale, cropping, and rotating images. This script is run directly and manipulates the image specified in the code.

    python images.py

## Notes
The paths to images and directories need to be adjusted according to your file system. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to read and write files in the specified directories.
